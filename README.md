### Welcome to my code dump

I prefer to drop to the github all my pet projects, code exercizes and practice tasks. Legacy code of pre-historic ages is also included.

Javascript, Typescript and PHP are here mostly for moniez, all the other stuff (Unity/C#, Python, etc.) is for education, entertainment and hobbies.
