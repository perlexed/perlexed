### Welcome to my code dump

I prefer to drop to github all the pet projects, code exercizes and practice tasks. Legacy code of pre-historic ages is included.

Javascript, Typescript and PHP are mostly for moniez, all the other stuff (Unity/C#, Python, etc.) is for education, entertainment and hobbies.
